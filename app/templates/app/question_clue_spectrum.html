    <h2> Clue Giving </h2>
    <h4> 
      Wavelength is all about wildly creative clues. 
      Firm Rules
        1. A clue shouldn't combine multiple ideas or give a lot of explanatory context.
        2. The clue must exist as a thing in the universe outside of you giving the clue.
        3. You aren't allowed to use one side as a double meaning, e.g. "hot" meaning attractive-though
        4. You can't use numbers, percentages, ratios, or anything numeric to sneakily suggest the location of the target.
      
      Suggestions:
        1. Be concise: Try to use five words or fewer
        2. No modifiers: Words like "but", "very", "almost", "slightly", 
           and "kind of" nearly always makes a team weigh the thing itself versus the qualifier used
        3. Use proper nouns
